# Arun Khadka - Portfolio Website

Hey there! Welcome to my personal portfolio website. This is where I showcase my journey as a full-stack developer and share the projects I'm passionate about.

## What's This All About?

This is my digital home on the web - a place where I can show off what I've been working on, share a bit about myself, and hopefully connect with other developers, potential collaborators, or anyone interested in what I do.

I built this portfolio because I wanted something that truly represents me and my work. It's clean, modern, and built with technologies I love working with.

## What You'll Find Here

- **About Me**: A little insight into who I am, my background, and what drives me as a developer
- **My Projects**: A showcase of the work I'm most proud of, with details about the technologies used and challenges solved
- **Skills**: The tools and technologies I work with, from frontend frameworks to backend systems
- **Contact**: Ways to get in touch if you'd like to chat about opportunities, collaborations, or just say hello

## Built With

I chose these technologies because they're powerful, modern, and frankly, a joy to work with:

- **React** - For building the interactive user interface
- **TypeScript** - Because type safety makes everything better
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling that's both beautiful and maintainable
- **Shadcn/ui** - Clean, accessible UI components
- **Supabase** - Backend services and database (for future features)

## Why These Choices?

I'm all about using the right tool for the job. React gives me the component-based architecture I love, TypeScript catches errors before they become problems, and Tailwind lets me style quickly without writing tons of custom CSS. Vite makes the development experience smooth and fast, which means I can focus on building rather than waiting for builds.

## Getting Started

If you want to run this locally (maybe you're curious about the code, or want to use it as inspiration for your own portfolio):

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/khadkaarun/arun-khadka-web-portfolio.git

# Navigate to the project
cd arun-khadka-web-portfolio

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` and you'll see the site running locally.

## The Story Behind This

Building this portfolio was both a technical challenge and a personal journey. I wanted to create something that wasn't just another template-based site, but something that genuinely reflected my personality and approach to development.

Every component was thoughtfully crafted, every animation has a purpose, and every section tells part of my story as a developer. It's responsive, accessible, and built with performance in mind because those things matter to me in every project I work on.

## What's Next?

This portfolio is a living project. I'm constantly updating it with new work, refining the design, and adding features that make it more engaging. Some things I'm considering:

- A blog section to share thoughts on development
- Interactive project demos
- Dark/light theme toggle
- More animations and micro-interactions

## Let's Connect!

I'd love to hear from you! Whether you're a fellow developer, a potential collaborator, or someone with an interesting project, don't hesitate to reach out.
